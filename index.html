  <h1>Project 2: Abortion Access and Travel for Care</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Proposition:</strong> Restricting abortion access negatively impacts healthcare equity and forces more people to travel long distances for care.
  </p>

  <h2>Visualization 1: Out-of-State Travel for Abortion Care (2020)</h2>
  <img src="project2.png" alt="Bar chart showing states where residents travel out-of-state for abortion care">
  <p class="caption">
    The first chart visualizes the top 15 U.S. states where the highest percentage of residents had to leave their home state in 2020 to access abortion care. Missouri stands out with nearly 100% of residents seeking care elsewhere. This visualization highlights the geographic disparities in access and shows how lack of in-state facilities imposes a heavy burden on individuals.
  </p>

  <h2>Visualization 2: Lack of Abortion Clinics Across Counties (2020)</h2>
  <img src="project2_1.png" alt="Bar chart showing % of counties without abortion clinics in top 15 states">
  <p class="caption">
    The second chart shows the percentage of counties lacking abortion clinics in 2020. Arkansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi top the list, with nearly every county without access to an abortion clinic. This underlines the severe shortage of providers in many areas, reinforcing structural barriers to reproductive healthcare.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    I used horizontal bar charts to make state comparisons clear and intuitive. The charts are ordered by value, which allows the viewer to immediately identify the most affected states. I focused on the top 15 states to highlight the extremes, although I acknowledge this may not fully represent national trends. Orange was chosen for visibility and to maintain a consistent, neutral aesthetic.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This project set out to visually communicate how restrictions on abortion access in the U.S. exacerbate healthcare inequities, particularly through the lens of geographic availability and out-of-state travel burdens. The visualizations focus on the top 15 states with the most limited access, providing a clear, comparative view of where residents face the greatest challenges.
  </p>

  <h3>Design Justification:</h3>
  <p>
    I used horizontal bar charts for both visualizations to facilitate easier comparison of state-level data. Horizontal bars are especially effective for ranking and reading long state names without visual clutter. A consistent orange color was used to convey urgency without evoking partisan tones, and the same color was applied across charts to reinforce the theme. States are ordered from most to least affected to draw immediate attention to the severity of the issue. The use of percentages helps normalize for population size and offers a more equitable basis for comparison.
    In visualizing abortion-related data, I was highly conscious of the sensitivity of the topic and the ethical obligation to represent individualsâ€™ experiences with care and accuracy. I chose to show only aggregate, state-level data to avoid stigmatizing specific counties or populations. While the focus on the top 15 states means the national picture isn't fully represented, this was a deliberate design tradeoff to highlight acute disparities. Importantly, the charts avoid sensationalism and focus on clarity and accessibility. The goal was not to inflame debate but to inform, encouraging deeper inquiry and empathy toward those most affected by limited reproductive healthcare access.
